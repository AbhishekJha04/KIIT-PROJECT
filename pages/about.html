            <p>Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), a household name in the education sector, has become a sought-after destination in India for professional studies. It is admired all over for the quality of its academic courses, its community outreach work and as a university of compassion and humanitarianism. It has become a case study because no other educational institution in India has grown in its scope and scale as much as KIIT has in a short span of 25 years. Its incredible transformation is truly a journey from Soil to Silver.

                KIIT started in 1992-93 as an Industrial Training Institution. However, 1997 is considered the base year for the University as undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Engineering, Management and Computer Applications were added. In 2007, many new schools were added to its umbrella – School of Law, Biotechnology, Medical Sciences, Dental Sciences, Nursing, Mass Communication, Film and Media, Fashion and KIIT International School. Since then, there has been no looking back! Today, KIIT offers professional education to around 40,000 students from across India. This includes 2000 international students from 65 countries. The alumni of KIIT, over a lakh of them, have made their mark in their respective careers in academics, corporate organizations, civil services and enterprise.
                
                One would find it difficult to imagine that such a celebrated institution with a global reputation was established by an unassuming humble being, Dr Achyuta Samanta, the Founder of KIIT and KISS, who started the institute with all of Rs 5000 as the initial investment. He had big dreams and a passion to make a difference. Dr Samanta started KIIT in two rented rooms with 12 students and 2 staff. The modest institution has now grown to incomprehensible propositions and is spread over a vast 36-square-kilometre academic township. Its 25 lush green campuses employ over 3000 eminent faculty and researchers and 15000 staff. KIIT and KISS together is a family of over a lakh people. The campus houses a 2600-bedded super speciality hospital, KIMS, a multi-storey central library, a central research facility, a 22-storey research and innovation wing, auditoriums – the largest one with 5000 seating capacity, 18 sports complexes, many  </p>

            <div class="over-box">
                <p>international standard stadiums covering all sports, 30 food courts, and a rose garden. The institution takes pride in being the greenest campus in India.

                    It has received all accreditations and affiliations from prestigious national and international bodies such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), USA and the Institution of Engineering and Technology, (IET), UK because of its quality research, innovation, and publications and citations. KIIT has had an excellent placement record since its inception owing to its quality teaching and learning process, and the brand value that it carries. KIIT is ranked in the cohort of 601-800 in the Times Higher Education ‘World University Ranking 2024’. Its Computer Science Engineering ranks in the cohort of 301-400 and its overall Engineering ranking is 401-500 in the world. KIIT has been accredited with an A++ grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with an all-India 16th rank by the National Institution of Ranking Framework, NIRF, Ministry of Education. It has also been the top university for innovation among private institutions for two consecutive years (2020, 2021) according to AICTE, Government of India. It has been ranked among the top 151-200 universities in the world as per the Times Higher Education Young University Ranking 2022.
                    
                    KIIT has made colossal contributions to Sports. Currently, 11 Olympians pursue their education at KIIT. The University has been conferred the Sportstar Award and FICCI India Sports Award for the promotion of sports. KIIT and KISS are the nodal centres for the FIFA Football For Schools Programme in Asia. KIIT has been chosen for the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puruskar 2022 for encouraging sports through Corporate Social Responsibility. Besides its immense contribution to the development of the state and the city, KIIT has also promoted local art, culture, sculpture, rural development, literature and spiritualism. All the achievements of KIIT have been possible because of its founder – Dr Achyuta Samanta – lovingly called Samanta Sir – the epitome of principles, discipline, hard work, and selfless service. It truly is an inspiring story of a humble man steering two institutions to glory despite all the hardships and struggles.

            <p>KIIT – Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology derives its name from a combination of historical, geographical, and symbolic elements, reflecting the institution’s journey and vision over the years. The name “Kalinga” pays tribute to the ancient region of Kalinga, which was situated in present-day Odisha. Kalinga holds significant historical importance, known for its rich heritage and contributions to culture and learning. Notably, it is also remembered for the Kalinga War, where Emperor Ashoka’s conquest of Kalinga led to a profound transformation in his life as he embraced the path of non-violence and peace. By incorporating “Kalinga” in its name, KIIT aims to draw inspiration from this historical legacy of peace and enlightenment.

                KIIT’s journey began as an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) before evolving into a full-fledged university. Therefore, the initial inclusion of “IIT” in the name represented its humble origins and focus on technical education. Over the years, KIIT has witnessed </p>

            <p>
                remarkable growth and expansion,offering diverse disciplines and becoming a prominent center for professional education and research. The evolution from “ITI” to a world-famous university, KIIT is a story of progress in becoming a comprehensive educational hub.

The letter “K” in the name can be attributed to a fascination with the symbolism of this letter as a lucky charm by its Founder, Dr. Achyuta Samanta. The letter “K” has come to represent a symbol of prosperity and success, guiding its path as it continues to grow and make strides in the field of education. Starting from his birthplace to his Gotra (clan) and everything created by him till now starts with “K” and ends with success.

The name “KIIT” is a thoughtful blend of history, origins, growth, and a touch of symbolism, embodying the institution’s commitment to providing quality education and being the University of humanity and compassion, fostering peace, and embracing the journey of progress and transformation.</p>
